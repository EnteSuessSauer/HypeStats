# API Client Update Prompt

This is a placeholder file that could be used to store specific prompts for AI assistance with enhancing the API client.

Example prompt template:

```
I need to update the API client (src/api_client.py) to implement a more robust rate limiting mechanism.
The current approach uses a simple time delay between requests, but I want to switch to a token bucket algorithm.

Specific requirements:
1. Maintain separate rate limits for Hypixel API (120 req/min) and Mojang API (600 req/10min)
2. Implement proper request queuing to handle concurrent requests gracefully
3. Add retry logic for failed requests with exponential backoff
4. Ensure the implementation is thread-safe

Please guide me through this implementation, showing the updated code structure and explaining the changes.
```

Additional prompt ideas:
- Adding caching to the API client
- Implementing batch processing for multiple usernames
- Adding support for new Hypixel API endpoints
- Improving error handling and recovery mechanisms
